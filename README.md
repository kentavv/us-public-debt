# us-public-debt

## Background
This was created to examine the doom-gloom articles about the interest on the US Public Debt. 
E.g., that interest payments were exploding as debt renews, and that Treasury should have issued far more low-yield long-end. 

## Observations
Current weighted yield of the debt is 3%. 
Current annual interest is $0.8T, increasing to $1.3T by 2032 if renewed at 5.2% AND no new debt added.

More concerning than interest payments is the change in the rate of debt accumulated.
The rate accelerated during the GFC and slightly during COVID and October '23.

Articles seem overly doomy, but spending will increase. Who knows. 
Would have been impractical to issue a lot of long-end because the long-end only appeals to certain clientele, and the insurance would not have cleared.

## Utility

Probably nothing for investors. If rates were too high, all assets would not be ripping higher. More evidence to ignore the news. 

## Misc

Only marketable securities are considered.

Data should be normalized. GFD seems natural, but GFD is influenced by debt.
